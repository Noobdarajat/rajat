    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. They are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Snakes are highly adaptable creatures found in a variety of habitats, from dense forests to arid deserts. They play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance by controlling pest populations and serving as both predators and prey in the food chain. Despite their fearsome reputation, most snake species are non-venomous and pose no threat to humans. Their unique physiology, including the ability to dislocate their jaws to consume large prey, makes them one of the most fascinating creatures in the animal kingdom.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em; text-decoration: underline; background-color: grey; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;">Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Snakes have a flexible body with no limbs, allowing them to slither and maneuver through various terrains.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">They can range in size from a few inches, like the Barbados threadsnake, to over 30 feet, such as the reticulated python.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Most snakes have a long, forked tongue used for sensing their environment by collecting airborne particles and analyzing them with the Jacobson's organ.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Snakes have specialized scales on their belly, called ventral scales, which provide grip and aid in movement and climbing.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Their jawbones are highly flexible, connected by stretchy ligaments, allowing them to swallow prey much larger than their head.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Some snakes, like pit vipers, pythons, and boas, have heat-sensing pits that detect infrared radiation from warm-blooded prey.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Snakes have no eyelids; instead, their eyes are covered by a transparent scale called a spectacle, which is shed during molting.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Their skeletal structure is highly specialized, with hundreds of vertebrae and ribs providing flexibility and strength.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Snakes rely on their keen sense of smell and vibrations to detect predators and prey, as they lack external ears.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Some species, like the spitting cobra, can eject venom as a defense mechanism, aiming for the eyes of predators.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Snakes exhibit a wide variety of colors and patterns, which serve as camouflage, warning signals, or mimicry to deter predators.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">The scales of snakes are made of keratin, the same material as human hair and nails, and provide protection and reduce water loss.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em; text-decoration: underline; background-color: grey; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;">Cure After a Snake Bite</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">If bitten by a snake, immediate medical attention is crucial, as the severity of the bite depends on the species of snake, the location of the bite, and the amount of venom injected. The first step is to remain calm and avoid panic, as increased heart rate can spread the venom more quickly through the bloodstream. Immobilize the affected limb and keep it at or slightly below heart level to slow venom circulation. Avoid applying ice, cutting the wound, or attempting to suck out the venom, as these actions can worsen the injury. Remove any tight clothing or jewelry near the bite site to prevent constriction due to swelling. Seek emergency medical care as soon as possible, where antivenom, the most effective treatment for venomous snake bites, can be administered. Antivenom is specifically designed to neutralize the venom and prevent further damage. Supportive care, such as pain management, wound care, and monitoring for allergic reactions, may also be necessary. In some cases, additional treatments like blood transfusions or surgery may be required to address complications. It is important to identify the snake, if safe to do so, or describe its appearance to medical professionals to ensure the correct antivenom is used. Timely and appropriate treatment can significantly improve outcomes and reduce the risk of long-term effects or fatalities from snake bites.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em; text-decoration: underline; background-color: grey; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;">Habitat</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica. They inhabit a wide range of environments, including forests, deserts, grasslands, and wetlands. In forests, snakes often dwell in trees, under leaf litter, or within hollow logs, taking advantage of the dense vegetation for camouflage and hunting. Desert-dwelling snakes, such as sidewinders, have adapted to survive in extreme heat and arid conditions by burrowing into the sand or becoming nocturnal to avoid the scorching sun. Grasslands provide open spaces where snakes can hunt small mammals and bask in the sun, while wetlands and marshes are home to water snakes that thrive in aquatic environments, feeding on fish and amphibians. Some species, like sea snakes, are fully adapted to marine life, living in tropical oceans and rarely coming ashore. Snakes are highly adaptable and can even be found in urban areas, where they seek shelter in gardens, abandoned buildings, or near water sources. Their ability to thrive in diverse habitats highlights their resilience and ecological importance.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em; text-decoration: underline; background-color: grey; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;">Diet</h2>

   


    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Snakes are carnivorous and feed on a variety of prey, including rodents, birds, frogs, fish, insects, and even other snakes. They swallow their prey whole, thanks to their highly flexible jaws that can expand to accommodate large meals. Some species, like pythons and boas, use constriction to subdue their prey, while venomous snakes inject venom to immobilize or kill their target. The diet of a snake largely depends on its size, habitat, and species. For example, smaller snakes may feed on insects and small amphibians, while larger snakes, such as anacondas, can consume animals as large as deer or capybaras. Aquatic snakes primarily hunt fish and amphibians, while arboreal snakes often prey on birds and eggs. Snakes have a slow metabolism, allowing them to survive on infrequent meals, sometimes going weeks or even months without eating after a large meal.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em; text-decoration: underline; background-color: grey; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;">Interesting Facts</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">There are over 3,000 species of snakes worldwide.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Some snakes, like pythons and boas, kill their prey by constriction.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Venomous snakes use their venom to immobilize or kill their prey.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.2em;">Snakes shed their skin periodically in a process called molting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em; text-decoration: underline; background-color: grey; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;">Snake Behavior</h2>

    <img src="gif 1.jpg" alt="Types of Snakes" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; width: 12%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;" onmouseover="this.style.transform='scale(1.1)'" onmouseout="this.style.transform='scale(1)'"
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Snakes are generally solitary creatures, preferring to live and hunt alone. They rely on their keen sense of smell, heat-sensing pits, and vibrations to locate prey and navigate their surroundings. Most snakes are ambush predators, lying in wait for unsuspecting prey to come within striking distance. Others actively hunt, using their agility and stealth to capture prey. Snakes are ectothermic, meaning they regulate their body temperature through external sources like sunlight or warm surfaces. They are most active during specific times of the day or night, depending on the species and environmental conditions.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">During the mating season, snakes exhibit unique behaviors, such as combat dances between males or pheromone trails left by females to attract mates. Some species, like garter snakes, form mating balls where multiple males compete to mate with a single female. After mating, female snakes may lay eggs or give birth to live young, depending on the species. Parental care is rare among snakes, though some species, like pythons, guard their eggs until they hatch.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Snakes are also known for their defensive behaviors. When threatened, they may hiss, rattle their tails, flatten their bodies, or display their fangs to intimidate predators. Some species, like cobras, raise their hoods as a warning, while others, like the hognose snake, play dead to avoid confrontation. These behaviors highlight the adaptability and survival strategies of snakes in the wild.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em; text-decoration: underline; background-color: grey; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;">Conservation</h2>
